        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>Office Hours was conceived of, designed, and implemented by
            <a href='http://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/~richard'>Richard McKenna</a>
            of <a href='http://www.cs.stonybrook.edu'>Stony Brook University</a>.
            The application was built in order to help learning about making
            user interface frameworks and employs the <strong>PropertiesManager</strong>,
            <strong>jTPS</strong>, and <strong>Desktop Java Framework</strong> libraries,
            also created by and maintained by Richard McKenna.<br />
