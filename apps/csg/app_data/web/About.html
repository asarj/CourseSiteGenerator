        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>The Course Site Generator was conceived of, designed, and implemented by
            <!-- <a href='http://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/~richard'>Richard McKenna</a> -->
            Ajay Sarjoo
            of <a href='http://www.cs.stonybrook.edu'>Stony Brook University</a>.
            The application was built in order to help learning about making
            user interface frameworks and employs the <strong>PropertiesManager</strong>,
            <strong>jTPS</strong>, and <strong>Desktop Java Framework</strong> libraries,
            created by and maintained by Richard McKenna.<br />

            The Course Site Generator aims to help instructors generate and update websites for their course content.
            Our site generator will automate the process of creating our course website
            to greatly reduce the amount of time needed in planning a semester and update
            it as it progresses. In order to do that our application will provide a website
            template that all generated content will use where user entered data can be
            store in JSON files that can then be loaded using JavaScript.
