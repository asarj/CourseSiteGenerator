        <p>The Course Site Generator is a desktop Java application for creating and
            editing course website details. The app presents 5 tabs, one that lets you
            edit the course webpage settings, one that lets you edit the syllabus
            details, one that lets you adjust the meeting times of the course,
            one that lets you adjust the office hours of the TAs, and one that lets
            you edit the schedule of the course. The application saves data to
            a JSON format that can be used by Web pages for displaying
            course websites.
